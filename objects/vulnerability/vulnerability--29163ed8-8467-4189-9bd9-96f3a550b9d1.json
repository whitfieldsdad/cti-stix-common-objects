            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: mm: Fix the out of bound issue of vmemmap address\n\nIn sparse vmemmap model, the virtual address of vmemmap is calculated as:\n((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT)).\nAnd the struct page's va can be calculated with an offset:\n(vmemmap + (pfn)).\n\nHowever, when initializing struct pages, kernel actually starts from the\nfirst page from the same section that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the\nfirst page's physical address is not (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT), then\nwe get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it's struct page.\n\nFor example, if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000, the\nfirst page in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During\ninit_unavailable_range(), we will initialize struct page for pfn 0x80000\nwith virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000), which is\nbelow VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.\n\nThis commit fixes this bug by introducing a new variable\n'vmemmap_start_pfn' which is aligned with memory section size and using\nit to calculate vmemmap address instead of phys_ram_base.",

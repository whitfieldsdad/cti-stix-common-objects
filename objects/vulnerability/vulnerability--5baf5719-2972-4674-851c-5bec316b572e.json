            "description": "The Anih - Creative Agency WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2024 due to an incomplete blacklist, insufficient input sanitization, and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",

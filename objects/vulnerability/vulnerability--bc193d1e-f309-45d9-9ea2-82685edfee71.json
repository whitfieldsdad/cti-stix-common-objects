            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nafs: Fix the maximum cell name length\n\nThe kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but a\nproblem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create a\ndirectory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that fails\nwith a warning:\n\n        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405\n\nbecause procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255.\n\nHowever, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, the\nmaximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL).\n\nFix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  This\nalso allows us to be sure we can create the \"/afs/.<cell>/\" mountpoint too.\n\nFurther, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by\nthe protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it\nexceeds 253.",

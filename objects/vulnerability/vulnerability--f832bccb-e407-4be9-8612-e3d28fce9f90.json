            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLoongArch: Increase ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN up to 16\n\nARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is 1 by default, but some LoongArch-specific devices\n(such as APBDMA) require 16 bytes alignment. When the data buffer length\nis too small, the hardware may make an error writing cacheline. Thus, it\nis dangerous to allocate a small memory buffer for DMA. It's always safe\nto define ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN as L1_CACHE_BYTES but unnecessary (kmalloc()\nneed small memory objects). Therefore, just increase it to 16.",

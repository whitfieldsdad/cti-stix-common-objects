            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Fix error handling path in bnxt_init_chip()\n\nWARN_ON() is triggered in __flush_work() if bnxt_init_chip() fails\nbecause we call cancel_work_sync() on dim work that has not been\ninitialized.\n\nWARNING: CPU: 37 PID: 5223 at kernel/workqueue.c:4201 __flush_work.isra.0+0x212/0x230\n\nThe driver relies on the BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED bit to check if dim\nwork has already been cancelled.  But in the bnxt_open() path,\nBNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED is not set and this causes the error\npath to think that it needs to cancel the uninitalized dim work.\nFix it by setting BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED during initialization.\nThe bit will be cleared when we enable NAPI and initialize dim work.",

            "description": "The InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.0.83. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the '/migrate/templates/main.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.",

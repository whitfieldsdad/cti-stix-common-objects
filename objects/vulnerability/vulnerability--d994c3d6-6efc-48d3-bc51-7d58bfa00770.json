            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrhashtable: Fix potential deadlock by moving schedule_work outside lock\n\nMove the hash table growth check and work scheduling outside the\nrht lock to prevent a possible circular locking dependency.\n\nThe original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to\na potential deadlock scenario involving nested locks between\nrhashtable bucket, rq lock, and dsq lock. By relocating the\ngrowth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock, we break\nthis potential deadlock chain.\n\nThis change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing\nrestrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler\nand workqueue contexts.\n\nImport to say that this calls rht_grow_above_75(), which reads from\nstruct rhashtable without holding the lock, if this is a problem, we can\nmove the check to the lock, and schedule the workqueue after the lock.\n\n\nModified so that atomic_inc is also moved outside of the bucket\nlock along with the growth above 75% check.",

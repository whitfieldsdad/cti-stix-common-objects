            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors\n\nUsing WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't give\nmore information than telling that something goes wrong, since the\nusual code path is a lregister callback from each control element\ncreation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if\nit were serious issues.\n\nThis patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()\ninstead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to\nthe prefix, too.",

            "description": "Patch traversal, External Control of File Name or Path vulnerability in  Iocharger Home allows deletion of arbitrary files\nThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model before firmware version 25010801.\n\nLikelihood: High, but requires authentication\n\nImpact: Critical â€“ The vulnerability can be used to delete any file on the charging station, severely impacting the integrity of the charging station. Furthermore, the vulnerability could be used to delete binaries required for the functioning of the charging station, severely impacting the availability of the charging station.\n\nCVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L), nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads compromised of the integrity and availability of the device (VVC:N/VI:H/VA:H), with no effect on subsequent systems (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). We do not forsee a safety impact (S:N). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).",

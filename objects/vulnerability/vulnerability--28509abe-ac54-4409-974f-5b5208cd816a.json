            "description": "The Ultimate Member â€“ User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to second-order SQL Injection via filenames in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with  access to upload files and manage filenames through a third-party plugin like a File Manager, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The risk of this vulnerability is very minimal as it requires a user to be able to manipulate filenames in order to successfully exploit.",

            "description": "Erik de Jong, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found that the VAPIX API ftptest.cgi did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a possible command injection leading to being able to transfer files from/to the Axis device. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an administrator-privileged service account. \nAxis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up\n\nCurrently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the\nvalid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some\nfunctions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One\nsuch example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -\n\nnl80211_remove_link()\n    cfg80211_remove_link()\n        ieee80211_del_intf_link()\n            ieee80211_vif_set_links()\n                ieee80211_vif_update_links()\n                    ieee80211_link_stop()\n                        cfg80211_cac_event()\n\ncfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared\nalready in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.\n\nTherefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link\nclean-up.",

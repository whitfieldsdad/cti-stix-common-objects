            "description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. When an Active Directory user resets their password, the system updates it without performing an LDAP bind to validate the new credentials against AD. This vulnerability allows users whose AD accounts are expired or disabled to regain access in Keycloak, bypassing AD restrictions. The issue enables authentication bypass and could allow unauthorized access under certain conditions.",

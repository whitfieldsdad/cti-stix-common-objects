            "description": "The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",

            "description": "The All-Images.ai â€“ IA Image Bank and Custom Image creation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the '_get_image_by_url' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",

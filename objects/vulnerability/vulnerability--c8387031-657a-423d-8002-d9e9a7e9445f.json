            "description": "The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Denial of Service in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.63. This is due to unlimited height and width parameters for CAPTCHA images. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send multiple requests with large values, resulting in slowing server resources if the server does not mitigate Denial of Service attacks.",

            "description": "The Increase Maximum Upload File Size | Increase Execution Time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to returning image upload error messages with full path information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

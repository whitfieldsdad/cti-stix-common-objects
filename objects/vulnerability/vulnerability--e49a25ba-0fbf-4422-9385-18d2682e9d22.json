            "description": "The Shared Files â€“ Frontend File Upload Form & Secure File Sharing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via dfxp File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.42 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the dfxp file. This issue affects only Apache-based environments, where dfxp files are handled by default.",

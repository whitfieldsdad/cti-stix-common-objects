            "description": "A vulnerability in man-group/dtale versions 3.15.1 allows an attacker to override global state settings to enable the `enable_custom_filters` feature, which is typically restricted to trusted environments. Once enabled, the attacker can exploit the /test-filter endpoint to execute arbitrary system commands, leading to remote code execution (RCE). This issue is addressed in version 3.16.1.",

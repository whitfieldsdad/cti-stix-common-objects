            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwatch_queue: fix pipe accounting mismatch\n\nCurrently, watch_queue_set_size() modifies the pipe buffers charged to\nuser->pipe_bufs without updating the pipe->nr_accounted on the pipe\nitself, due to the if (!pipe_has_watch_queue()) test in\npipe_resize_ring(). This means that when the pipe is ultimately freed,\nwe decrement user->pipe_bufs by something other than what than we had\ncharged to it, potentially leading to an underflow. This in turn can\ncause subsequent too_many_pipe_buffers_soft() tests to fail with -EPERM.\n\nTo remedy this, explicitly account for the pipe usage in\nwatch_queue_set_size() to match the number set via account_pipe_buffers()\n\n(It's unclear why watch_queue_set_size() does not update nr_accounted;\nit may be due to intentional overprovisioning in watch_queue_set_size()?)",

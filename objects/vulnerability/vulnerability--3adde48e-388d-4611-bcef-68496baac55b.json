            "description": "fleetdm/fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. In vulnerable versions of Fleet, an attacker could craft a specially-formed SAML response to forge authentication assertions, provision a new administrative user account if Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning is enabled, or create new accounts tied to forged assertions if f MDM enrollment is enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.64.2, 4.63.2, 4.62.4, and 4.58.1.",

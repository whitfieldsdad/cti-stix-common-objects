            "description": "When configured using SAML, a session fixation vulnerability in the GlobalProtect™ login enables an attacker to impersonate a legitimate authorized user and perform actions as that GlobalProtect user. This requires the legitimate user to first click on a malicious link provided by the attacker.\n\nThe SAML login for the PAN-OS® management interface is not affected. Additionally, this issue does not affect Cloud NGFW and all Prisma® Access instances are proactively patched.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: timer: Don't take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user()\n\nThe infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often\nproblematic when it's called inside another mutex, as they might lead\nto deadlocks.\n\nIn the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with\nguard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- which\nwas mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had been\ncarefully worked around in the past.\n\nThis patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() out\nof the register mutex lock again.",

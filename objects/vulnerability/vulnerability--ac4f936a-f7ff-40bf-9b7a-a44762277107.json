            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view, modify, and delete data without proper authorization.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to limit access to resources that are intended for users with Administrator privileges. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to list, view, create, edit, and delete templates in the same manner as a user with Administrator privileges.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

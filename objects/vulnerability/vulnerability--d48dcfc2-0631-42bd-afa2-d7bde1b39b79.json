            "description": "There exists a stack buffer overflow in libjxl. A specifically-crafted file can cause the JPEG XL decoder to use large amounts of stack space (up to 256mb is possible, maybe 512mb), potentially exhausting the stack. An attacker can craft a file that will cause excessive memory usage. We recommend upgrading past commit 65fbec56bc578b6b6ee02a527be70787bbd053b0.",

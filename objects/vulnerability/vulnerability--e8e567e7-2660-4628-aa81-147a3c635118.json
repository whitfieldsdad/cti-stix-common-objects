            "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GlobalProtect™ gateway and portal features of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal user's browser when they click on a specially crafted link. The primary risk is phishing attacks that can lead to credential theft—particularly if you enabled Clientless VPN.\n\nThere is no availability impact to GlobalProtect features or GlobalProtect users. Attackers cannot use this vulnerability to tamper with or modify contents or configurations of the GlobalProtect portal or gateways. The integrity impact of this vulnerability is limited to enabling an attacker to create phishing and credential-stealing links that appear to be hosted on the GlobalProtect portal.\n\n\n\nFor GlobalProtect users with Clientless VPN enabled, there is a limited impact on confidentiality due to inherent risks of Clientless VPN that facilitate credential theft. You can read more about this risk in the informational bulletin  PAN-SA-2025-0005 https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005   https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005 . There is no impact to confidentiality for GlobalProtect users if you did not enable (or you disable) Clientless VPN.",

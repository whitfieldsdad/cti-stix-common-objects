            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the PBAP_DecodeVCARD function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",

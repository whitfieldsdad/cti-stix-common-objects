            "description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that exposed secret values in error messages and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. The vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.13.4, v2.12.10, and v2.11.13.",

            "description": "The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the 'class_fma_connector.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",

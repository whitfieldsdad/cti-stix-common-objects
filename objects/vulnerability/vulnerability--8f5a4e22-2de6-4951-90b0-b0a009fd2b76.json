            "description": "The EventON Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check in the 'assets/lib/settings/settings.js' file in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.",

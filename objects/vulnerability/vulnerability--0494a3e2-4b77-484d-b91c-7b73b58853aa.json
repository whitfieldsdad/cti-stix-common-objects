            "description": "In version 0.4.1 of danswer-ai/danswer, a vulnerability exists where a basic user can create credentials and link them to an existing connector. This issue arises because the system allows an unauthenticated attacker to sign up with a basic account and perform actions that should be restricted to admin users. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) and other significant issues, impacting the system's stability and security.",

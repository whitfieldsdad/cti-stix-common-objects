            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation\n\nThe JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 <<\nl2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB\naggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined\nbehavior and improper AG sizing.\n\nOn 32-bit architectures:\n- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow\n- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in\nsbi->bmap->db_agsize\n- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures\n- Could lead to:\n  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations\n  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses\n  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures\n\nFix by casting to s64 before shifting:\nbmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;\n\nThis ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast\nmatches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in\nJFS block calculation code.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",

            "description": "The Templines Elementor Helper Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.7. This is due to allowing arbitrary user meta updates. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to Administrator. The vulnerability can only be exploited when the BuddyPress plugin is also installed and activated.",

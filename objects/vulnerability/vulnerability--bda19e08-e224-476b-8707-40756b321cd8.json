            "description": "Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, are vulnerable to command injection. \nDuring the initialization process, a user has to use a mobile app to provide devices with Access Point credentials. This input is not properly sanitized, what allows for command injection.\nThe vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.",

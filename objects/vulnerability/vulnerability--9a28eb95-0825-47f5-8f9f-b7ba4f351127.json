            "description": "The ThePerfectWedding.nl Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'update_option' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the 'tpwKey' option with stored cross-site scripting via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

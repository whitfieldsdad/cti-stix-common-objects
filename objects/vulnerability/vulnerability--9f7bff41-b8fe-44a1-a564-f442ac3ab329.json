            "description": "The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the mj_smgt_load_documets_new() and mj_smgt_load_documets() functions in all versions up to, and including, 91.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",

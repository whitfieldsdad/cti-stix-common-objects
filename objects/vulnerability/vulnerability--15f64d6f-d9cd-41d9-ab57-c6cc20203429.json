            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology: Correct get_control_data for non bytes payload\n\nIt is possible to craft a topology where sof_get_control_data() would do\nout of bounds access because it expects that it is only called when the\npayload is bytes type.\nConfusingly it also handles other types of controls, but the payload\nparsing implementation is only valid for bytes.\n\nFix the code to count the non bytes controls and instead of storing a\npointer to sof_abi_hdr in sof_widget_data (which is only valid for bytes),\nstore the pointer to the data itself and add a new member to save the size\nof the data.\n\nIn case of non bytes controls we store the pointer to the chanv itself,\nwhich is just an array of values at the end.\n\nIn case of bytes control, drop the wrong cdata->data (wdata[i].pdata) check\nagainst NULL since it is incorrect and invalid in this context.\nThe data is pointing to the end of cdata struct, so it should never be\nnull.",

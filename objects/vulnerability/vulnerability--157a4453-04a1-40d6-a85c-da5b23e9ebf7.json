            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/fbdev-dma: Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O\n\nDMA areas are not necessarily backed by struct page, so we cannot\nrely on it for deferred I/O. Allocate a shadow buffer for drivers\nthat require deferred I/O and use it as framebuffer memory.\n\nFixes driver errors about being \"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer\ndereference at virtual address\" or \"Unable to handle kernel paging\nrequest at virtual address\".\n\nThe patch splits drm_fbdev_dma_driver_fbdev_probe() in an initial\nallocation, which creates the DMA-backed buffer object, and a tail\nthat sets up the fbdev data structures. There is a tail function for\ndirect memory mappings and a tail function for deferred I/O with\nthe shadow buffer.\n\nIt is no longer possible to use deferred I/O without shadow buffer.\nIt can be re-added if there exists a reliably test for usable struct\npage in the allocated DMA-backed buffer object.",

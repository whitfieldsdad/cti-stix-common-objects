            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state\n\nIn get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..) if\ncb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(),\nthe skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb).\nThen get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by\nreturn value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.\n\nWhat's worse, the same problem goes even further: skb can also be\nfreed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below.\nThus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.\n\nMy patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done\nand notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen.\nSo that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.\n\nv2 reports a compilation warning. This v3 fixed this warning and built\nsuccessfully in my local environment with no additional warnings.\nv2: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1435218/",

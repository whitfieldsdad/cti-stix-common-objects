            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue\n\nIn the expression \"cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count\", both variables are u32\nvalues that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer\nwrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also\ncould potentially wrap.  The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\"\nmultiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on\n64bit systems.\n\nThis patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in\nuverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on\none side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified\nall the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.",

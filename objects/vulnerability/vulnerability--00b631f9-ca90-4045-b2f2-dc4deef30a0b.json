            "description": "Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to 0.8.2 , a path traversal attack allows existing non-admin users to access and take over other user's repositories. A malicious user then can modify, delete, and arbitrarily repositories as if they were an admin user without explicitly giving them permissions. This is patched in v0.8.2.",

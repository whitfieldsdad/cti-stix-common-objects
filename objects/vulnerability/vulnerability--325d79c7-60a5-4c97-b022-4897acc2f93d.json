User-supplied XML is parsed without appropriate restrictions, enabling external entity resolution.\n\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to read files from the serverâ€™s filesystem or perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\n\n\n  *  \nOn systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8, full file contents may be exposed.\n\n\n\n\n  *  \nOn later versions of JDK 8 and newer, only the first line of a file may be read, due to improvements in XML parser behavior.\n\n\n\n\n  *  \nDoS attacks such as \"Billion Laughs\" payloads can cause service disruption.",

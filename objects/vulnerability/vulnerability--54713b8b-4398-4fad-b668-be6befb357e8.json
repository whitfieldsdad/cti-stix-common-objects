            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject struct_ops registration that uses module ptr and the module btf_id is missing\n\nThere is a UAF report in the bpf_struct_ops when CONFIG_MODULES=n.\nIn particular, the report is on tcp_congestion_ops that has\na \"struct module *owner\" member.\n\nFor struct_ops that has a \"struct module *owner\" member,\nit can be extended either by the regular kernel module or\nby the bpf_struct_ops. bpf_try_module_get() will be used\nto do the refcounting and different refcount is done\nbased on the owner pointer. When CONFIG_MODULES=n,\nthe btf_id of the \"struct module\" is missing:\n\nWARN: resolve_btfids: unresolved symbol module\n\nThus, the bpf_try_module_get() cannot do the correct refcounting.\n\nNot all subsystem's struct_ops requires the \"struct module *owner\" member.\ne.g. the recent sched_ext_ops.\n\nThis patch is to disable bpf_struct_ops registration if\nthe struct_ops has the \"struct module *\" member and the\n\"struct module\" btf_id is missing. The btf_type_is_fwd() helper\nis moved to the btf.h header file for this test.\n\nThis has happened since the beginning of bpf_struct_ops which has gone\nthrough many changes. The Fixes tag is set to a recent commit that this\npatch can apply cleanly. Considering CONFIG_MODULES=n is not\ncommon and the age of the issue, targeting for bpf-next also.",

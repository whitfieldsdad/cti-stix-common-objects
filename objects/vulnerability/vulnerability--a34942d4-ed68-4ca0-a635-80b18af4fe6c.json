            "description": "The TP-Link Tapo C500 V1 and V2 are a pan-and-tilt outdoor Wi-Fi security cameras designed for comprehensive surveillance. \n\nThis vulnerability exists in Tapo C500 Wi-Fi camera due to hard-coded RSA private key embedded within the device firmware. An attacker with physical access could exploit this vulnerability to obtain cryptographic private keys which can then be used to perform impersonation, data decryption and man in the middle attacks on the targeted device.",

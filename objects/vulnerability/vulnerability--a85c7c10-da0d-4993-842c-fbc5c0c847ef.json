            "description": "A vulnerability in the application data endpoints of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within requests to application programmatic interfaces (APIs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an API within the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and gain access to sensitive information including credentials or user tokens.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

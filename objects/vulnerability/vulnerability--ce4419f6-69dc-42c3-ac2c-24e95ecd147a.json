            "description": "The `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files reveal hard-coded password hashes for the operating system \"root\" user. The credentials are shipped with the update files. There is no option for deleting or changing their passwords for an enduser. An attacker can use the credentials to log into the device. Authentication can be performed via SSH backdoor or likely via physical access (UART shell).",

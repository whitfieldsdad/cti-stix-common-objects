            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc\n\nAs described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class\nhas a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming\nthat checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted\nthe class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem\nduplicate case).\n\nThis patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code\nwon't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the\nreentrant case.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",

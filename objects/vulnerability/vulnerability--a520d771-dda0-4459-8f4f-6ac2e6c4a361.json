            "description": "The Active Products Tables for WooCommerce. Use constructor to create tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'shortcodes_set' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

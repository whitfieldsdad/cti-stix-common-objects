            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT\n\nThe function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination\ncondition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog\ncounters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the\ntraversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the\nactual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.\nIn case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.\n\nPrevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT\n(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.",

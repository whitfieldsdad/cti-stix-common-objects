            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imx-jpeg: fix a bug of accessing array out of bounds\n\nWhen error occurs in parsing jpeg, the slot isn't acquired yet, it may\nbe the default value MXC_MAX_SLOTS.\nIf the driver access the slot using the incorrect slot number, it will\naccess array out of bounds.\nThe result is the driver will change num_domains, which follows\nslot_data in struct mxc_jpeg_dev.\nThen the driver won't detach the pm domain at rmmod, which will lead to\nkernel panic when trying to insmod again.",

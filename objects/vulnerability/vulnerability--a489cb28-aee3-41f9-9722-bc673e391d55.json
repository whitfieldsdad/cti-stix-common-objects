            "description": "This vulnerability affects Snowplow Collector 3.x before 3.3.0 (unless itâ€™s set up behind a reverse proxy that establishes payload limits). It involves sending very large payloads to the Collector and can render it unresponsive to the rest of the requests. As a result, data would not enter the pipeline and would be potentially lost.",

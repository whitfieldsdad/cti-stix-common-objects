            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLSM: general protection fault in legacy_parse_param\n\nThe usual LSM hook \"bail on fail\" scheme doesn't work for cases where\na security module may return an error code indicating that it does not\nrecognize an input.  In this particular case Smack sees a mount option\nthat it recognizes, and returns 0. A call to a BPF hook follows, which\nreturns -ENOPARAM, which confuses the caller because Smack has processed\nits data.\n\nThe SELinux hook incorrectly returns 1 on success. There was a time\nwhen this was correct, however the current expectation is that it\nreturn 0 on success. This is repaired.",

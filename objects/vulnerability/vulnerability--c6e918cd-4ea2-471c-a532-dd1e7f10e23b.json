            "description": "Jmix is a set of libraries and tools to speed up Spring Boot data-centric application development. In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, attackers could manipulate the FileRef parameter to access files on the system where the Jmix application is deployed, provided the application server has the necessary permissions. This can be accomplished either by modifying the FileRef directly in the database or by supplying a harmful value in the fileRef parameter of the `/files` endpoint of the generic REST API. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.",

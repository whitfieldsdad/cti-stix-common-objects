            "description": "The Tutor LMS Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the install_etlms_dependency_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install Elementor or Tutor LMS. Please note the impact of this issue is incredibly limited due to the fact that these two plugins will likely already be installed as a dependency of the plugin.",

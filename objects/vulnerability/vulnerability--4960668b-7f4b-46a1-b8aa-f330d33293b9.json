This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on affected installations of Sante PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of DCM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations.

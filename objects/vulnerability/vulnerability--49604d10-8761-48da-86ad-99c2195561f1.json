            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget\n\nThe cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit\n58f2fcb3a845 (\"usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget\").\n\nUnder PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network\ntraffic, for example using \"iperf --bidir\" over NCM ethernet link.\n\nThe deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets\npreempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock.\nPrevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.",

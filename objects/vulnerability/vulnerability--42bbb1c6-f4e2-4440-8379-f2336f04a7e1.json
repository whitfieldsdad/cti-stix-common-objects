            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: uvcvideo: Fix double free in error path\n\nIf the uvc_status_init() function fails to allocate the int_urb, it will\nfree the dev->status pointer but doesn't reset the pointer to NULL. This\nresults in the kfree() call in uvc_status_cleanup() trying to\ndouble-free the memory. Fix it by resetting the dev->status pointer to\nNULL after freeing it.\n\nReviewed by: Ricardo Ribalda <ribalda@chromium.org>",

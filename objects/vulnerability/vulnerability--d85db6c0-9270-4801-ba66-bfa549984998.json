This leads to multiple unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.Â An unauthenticated attacker is able to compromise the sessions of users on the server by injecting JavaScript code into their session using an \"Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting\". The attacker is then able to ride the session of those users and can abuse their privileges on the \"bestinformed Web\" application.",

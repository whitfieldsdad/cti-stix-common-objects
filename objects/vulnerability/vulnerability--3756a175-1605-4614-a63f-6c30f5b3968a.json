            "description": "The MicroPayments â€“ Fans Paysite: Paid Creator Subscriptions, Digital Assets, Tokens Wallet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'videowhisper_content_upload_guest' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.29 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

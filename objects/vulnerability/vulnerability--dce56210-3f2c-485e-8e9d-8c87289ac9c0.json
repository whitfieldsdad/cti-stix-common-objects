            "description": "Zulip server provides an open-source team chat that helps teams stay productive and focused. Zulip Server 7.0 and above are vulnerable to an information disclose attack, where, if a Zulip server is hosting multiple organizations, an unauthenticated user can make a request and determine if an email address is in use by a user. Zulip Server 9.4 resolves the issue, as does the `main` branch of Zulip Server. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

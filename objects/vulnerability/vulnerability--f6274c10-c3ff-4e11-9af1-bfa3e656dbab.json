            "description": "An issue was discovered on Tuoshi/Dionlink LT15D 4G Wi-Fi devices through M7628NNxlSPv2xUI_v1.0.1802.10.08_P4 and LT21B devices through M7628xUSAxUIv2_v1.0.1481.15.02_P0. A unauthenticated remote attacker with network access can exploit a command injection vulnerability. The /goform/formJsonAjaxReq endpoint fails to sanitize shell metacharacters sent via JSON parameters, thus allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.",

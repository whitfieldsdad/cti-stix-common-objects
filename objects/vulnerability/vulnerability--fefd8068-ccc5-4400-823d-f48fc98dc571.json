            "description": "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. (CWE-863) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, have modules enabled by default that allow execution of system level processes. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen access control checks are incorrectly applied, users can access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures and denial of service.",

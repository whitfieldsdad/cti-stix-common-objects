            "description": "A vulnerability in certificate validation processing of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of certificates that are used by the Smart Licensing feature. An attacker with a privileged network position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting traffic that is sent over the Internet. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, including credentials used by the device to connect to Cisco cloud services.",

            "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Meeting Management could allow a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to elevate privileges to administrator on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because proper authorization is not enforced upon&nbsp;REST API users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a specific endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrator-level control over edge nodes that are managed by Cisco Meeting Management.",

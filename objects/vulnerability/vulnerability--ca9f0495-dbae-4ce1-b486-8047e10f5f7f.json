            "description": "A security vulnerability was discovered in the local status page functionality of Cisco Merakiâ€™s MX67 and MX68 security appliance models that may allow unauthenticated individuals to access and download logs containing sensitive, privileged device information. The vulnerability is due to improper access control to the files holding debugging and maintenance information, and is only exploitable when the local status page is enabled on the device. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability may obtain access to wireless pre-shared keys, Site-to-Site VPN key and other sensitive information. Under certain circumstances, this information may allow an attacker to obtain administrative-level access to the device.",

            "description": "Wyze Cam v3 Realtek Wi-Fi Driver Heap-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Realtek Wi-Fi kernel module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-22310.",

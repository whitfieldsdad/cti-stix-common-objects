            "description": "The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid, Carousel and Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the custom_attributes parameter of the Cookie Consent Widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.10.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Visteon Infotainment systems. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the REFLASH_DDU_ExtractFile function. A crafted software update file can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.

            "description": "The CE Phoenix eCommerce platform, starting in version 1.0.9.7 and prior to version 1.1.0.3, allowed logged-in users to delete their accounts without requiring password re-authentication. An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g., on a shared/public machine) could permanently delete the userâ€™s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.",

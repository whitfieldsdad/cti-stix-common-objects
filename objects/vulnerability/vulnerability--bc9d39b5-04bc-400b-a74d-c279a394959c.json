            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered\n\nRussell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL\npointer when unbinding this driver:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nThe crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL\ntolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.\n\nAt least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered\nsince the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():\n\n\t\tif (cond && !cond(chip))\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\nThese are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip\ndoes not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.\n\nTo fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.\nwere skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.",

            "description": "The Lock User Account plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user lock bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to permitting application password logins when user accounts are locked. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with existing application passwords, to interact with the vulnerable site via an API such as XML-RPC or REST despite their account being locked.",

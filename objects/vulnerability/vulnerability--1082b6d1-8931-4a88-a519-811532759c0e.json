            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nMIPS: pgalloc: fix memory leak caused by pgd_free()\n\npgd page is freed by generic implementation pgd_free() since commit\nf9cb654cb550 (\"asm-generic: pgalloc: provide generic pgd_free()\"),\nhowever, there are scenarios that the system uses more than one page as\nthe pgd table, in such cases the generic implementation pgd_free() won't\nbe applicable anymore. For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB is enabled and\nMIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro \"PGD_ORDER\"\nwill be set as \"1\", which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd\ntable. Well, at the same time, the generic implementation pgd_free()\njust free one pgd page, which will result in the memory leak.\n\nThe memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command:\n\"while true; do ls > /dev/null; grep MemFree /proc/meminfo; done\"",

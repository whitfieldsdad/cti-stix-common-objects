            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix WARNING \"do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING\"\n\nwait_event_timeout() will set the state of the current\ntask to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, before doing the condition check. This\nmeans that ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive() will try to acquire the mutex\nwhile already in a sleeping state. The scheduler warns us by giving\nthe following warning:\n\ndo not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=2 set at\n [<0000000061515a6f>] prepare_to_wait_event+0x9f/0x6c0\nWARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 4147 at kernel/sched/core.c:10099 __might_sleep+0x12f/0x160\n\nmutex lock is not needed in ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive().",

            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying file system of the device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient file scope limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specific file reference on the file system and then accessing it through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system of the underlying operating system.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

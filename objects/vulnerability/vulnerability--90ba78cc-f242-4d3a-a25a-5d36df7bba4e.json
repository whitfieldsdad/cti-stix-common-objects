            "description": "Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ.\n\nDuring unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections.\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.\n\nExisting users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: don't access invalid sched\n\nSince 2320c9e6a768 (\"drm/sched: memset() 'job' in drm_sched_job_init()\")\naccessing job->base.sched can produce unexpected results as the initialisation\nof (*job)->base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by the\nmemset.\n\nThis commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and would\nbe rejected after job->num_ibs is incremented. In this case,\namdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the\nmachine because the ring value is bogus.\n\nTo fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free(): we can do this\nbecause the device is actually not used in this function.\n\nThe next commit will remove the ring argument completely.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2ae520cb12831d264ceb97c61f72c59d33c0dbd7)",

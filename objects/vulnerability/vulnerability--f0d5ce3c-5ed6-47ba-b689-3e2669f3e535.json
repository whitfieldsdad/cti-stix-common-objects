            "description": "The I Am Gloria plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the iamgloria23_gloria_settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the tenant ID via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

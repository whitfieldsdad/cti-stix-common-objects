            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame\n\nAndrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service\nload-balancing in case of vmxnet3.\n\nIf a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as\nIPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case\nof vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped\non the path.\n\nvmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()\nthrough vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:\n\n  page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);\n  tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +\n                  VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;\n  dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev,\n                             tbi->dma_addr, buf_size,\n                             DMA_TO_DEVICE);\n\nThe above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP\nBPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is\ncorrect (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which\ncan be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data -\nxdp->data_hard_start.",

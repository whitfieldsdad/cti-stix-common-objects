The vulnerability occurs in the 'Create Knowledge' section when uploading DOCX files. If an external relationship exists in the DOCX file, the reltype value is requested as a URL using the 'requests' module instead of the 'ssrf_proxy', leading to an SSRF vulnerability. This issue was fixed in version 0.11.0.",

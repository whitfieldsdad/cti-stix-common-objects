            "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in `model_blender.py` lines 20 and 21. `model_fusion_a` and `model_fusion_b` from voice_blender.py take user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `run_model_blender_script` and later to `model_blender` function, which loads these two models with `torch.load` in `model_blender.py (on lines 20-21 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available on the `main` branch of the Applio repository.",

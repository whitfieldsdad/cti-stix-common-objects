            "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Tmall Demo up to 20250505. This affects an unknown part of the file /tmall/order/pay/ of the component Payment Identifier Handler. The manipulation leads to insufficiently random values. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

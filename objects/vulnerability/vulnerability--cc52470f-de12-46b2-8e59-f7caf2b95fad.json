            "description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. In versions starting from 2.4.0 to before 2.38.0, an authenticated CVAT user may be able to retrieve the IDs and names of all tasks, projects, labels, and the IDs of all jobs and quality reports on the CVAT instance. In addition, if the instance contains many resources of a particular type, retrieving this information may tie up system resources, denying access to legitimate users. This issue has been patched in version 2.38.0.",

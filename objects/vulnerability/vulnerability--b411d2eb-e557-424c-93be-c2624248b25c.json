            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nloop: Fix use-after-free issues\n\ndo_req_filebacked() calls blk_mq_complete_request() synchronously or\nasynchronously when using asynchronous I/O unless memory allocation fails.\nHence, modify loop_handle_cmd() such that it does not dereference 'cmd' nor\n'rq' after do_req_filebacked() finished unless we are sure that the request\nhas not yet been completed. This patch fixes the following kernel crash:\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000054\nCall trace:\n css_put.42938+0x1c/0x1ac\n loop_process_work+0xc8c/0xfd4\n loop_rootcg_workfn+0x24/0x34\n process_one_work+0x244/0x558\n worker_thread+0x400/0x8fc\n kthread+0x16c/0x1e0\n ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20",
